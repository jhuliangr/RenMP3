Application to make musiceasier to manage on PC.

Basically, what it does is remove the numbers at the beginning of the song names and the links at the end of them (e.g. "www.flowhot.net") so that they can be easily manipulated and sorted alphabetically.

Efforts are being made to remove promotional links from the music tags.
